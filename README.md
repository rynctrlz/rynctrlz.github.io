    <h1>Another Mall?</h1>
    <h2>New shopping mall in Minsk</h2>
    <p>
        Back in 2022, the construction of a new mall began in Minsk. Although there are a lot of shopping malls already, such as <b>Galileo</b>, <b>Galleria</b>, and <b>Dana Mall</b>, there is no sign of stopping when it comes to building more.

    <p>
        The <b>Minsk City Mall</b> is planned to house about 120 stores, of both Belarusian and foreign brands. On the ground floor, in addition to the Green supermarket, there are mobile operator stores, jewelry stores, an optician, and a pharmacy.

        Although at the moment there are only two stores and a supermarket, it is believed that by the end of 2023 more stores will open and there will be more things to explore. For now, people mostly drop in to buy groceries or wait for their bus and other city tranportation.
